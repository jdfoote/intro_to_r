Meh, that's Life.  But to answer your question thoroughly, let's backtrack a bit.  

I started contributing to Wikia on an occasional basis back in 2012.  As a creative writer, I've written fanfiction and original pieces.  Wikia offers a writer a chance to express themselves in a big way with ""articles.""  I didn't become a regular contributor until I discovered one particular fandom that I write for and whose Wikia had gone stale and abused by trolls.  This made me angry, so I started to edit big time and when I asked the admin if she needed help, she made me co-admin.  From there I simply waited until another fandom resonated deeply with me enough to write fanfiction and discovered that Wikia had also lost its admin and was growing stale.  So, at that point, having admin experience, I followed the necessary ""adoption"" steps and took over as admin there.  Same with my third wikia.

I thought that was it until I viewed a film and read a manga series that blew me away.  I went looking for the Wikia and what?  No Wikia?  Can't be.  But yes, it was true and that's what drove me to start this one as a Founder.  ","The parent company always stresses that the admins of a site are not The Emperor of China, but we're certainly more than what they claim we are which is ""the mop and bucket crew.""  Sorry, but if that's all the job entails, I don't want it.  A good admin knows they can't work alone and needs to have decent people skills and be able to communicate with others their ""vision.""  Every great admin has one and like a ship's captain, keeps steering the wikia towards that destination.  Adjustments are made along the way, but seriously, the best wikias are well-organized, well-written, and thorough in their knowledge of their topic (or on their way to being that expert).  Small wikias can be handled by one or two admins; but large wikias often have many admins.  I like the smaller ones or the ones not so busy that there are too many chefs (if you know what I mean).  It's a group project but every group in existence needs a leader, a go-to, a planner.  That's what I am for the wikias I administer (at least, I hope so).
